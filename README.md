## How to use

The following example runs Qr_Download and opens the qr code to download in your browser.

```js
var QR = require('android-download-via-qr');
QR('cordova/',{dontOpen:false});
```

It is really as simple as that!

To download it, scan the QR with a phone that is on the same network as your nodejs instance.
